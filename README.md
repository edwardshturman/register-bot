- Get an easy-to-read embed that displays where and when, along with a nice thumbnail of where you're headed ✨
- Visualize who can go when with up to four dates: `/event add <where> <unique emoji> <first proposed date> <second proposed date> ...` ✅
- Easily communicate event details with those going via a unique event role handed out to those that react 💬

## FAQ

#### So how about privacy — what and where is all of this stored?

Register logs the following:

- Discord server IDs, for associating events with your server
- Event names
- Event dates
- Event unique emojis
- Event embed message IDs, for tracking reactions
- Event role IDs, for handing out when someone reacts to an event message

Register **does not** log the following:

- Users who create or react to event messages
- Any server data not associated with event planning

All data is safely stored through MongoDB's cloud platform.

# 🚀 About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm Edward, and I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of San Francisco. 💻

Register is a Discord bot I made for my group of friends — after our high school graduation in May 2021, we wanted to make the most of our Summer together, and we needed a tool to make planning events, documenting availability, and tracking planning progress more convenient.

Well, here it is! I hope you enjoy, and I'll be updating it regularly for now. Go on and plan some epic events!
