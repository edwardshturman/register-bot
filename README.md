> Register is a multifunctional Discord bot I made for my group of friends, helping us plan trips and make memories.

The bot's main feature is trip planning: after our high school graduation in May 2021, we wanted to make the most of our Summer together, so we needed a tool to make planning events, documenting availability, and tracking planning progress more convenient.

Tech stack:

- discord.js
- MongoDB
- Unsplash API
- Heroku
- Google Calendar API *(coming soon!)*
- Notion API *(coming soon!)*
